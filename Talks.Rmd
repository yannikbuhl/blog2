### Automated Reporting (23.9.2020)

This is a talk about automation in data journalism that I gave at a CorrelAid Open Online Data Meetup in september. My talk was one of three regarding automation and data science. The session was called ‘The lazy data scientist: Automating things feat. R, Python, AWS, and a Raspberry Pi’. Down below, you find slides as well as a link to the YouTube video.
